# Gluecron Master To-Do List

Last updated: 2026-06-06 (rev 4 — full codebase audit complete, Bible is 35% of reality)

**IMPORTANT:** The BUILD_BIBLE.md documents ~35% of the actual codebase. 34 migrations (0043–0076) and 87+ lib files exist beyond what the Bible tracks. This list is based on direct code scanning, not the Bible.

Tick off items as they ship. Add `[x] YYYY-MM-DD commit:abc` when done.
Work top-to-bottom within each priority.

---

## 🔴 PRIORITY 1 — Configuration Blockers (Built, Just Not Configured)

These are NOT build tasks — the code is complete. They need ops/config action.

- [ ] **Verify SSH git push works end-to-end** — `src/lib/ssh-server.ts` is a full 545-line production implementation that starts at boot (`src/index.ts`). It handles `git-upload-pack` and `git-receive-pack`, does public-key auth against the `ssh_keys` table, and triggers post-receive hooks. Test from a clean machine: add an SSH key at `/settings`, then `git clone git@gluecron.com:user/repo.git`. If the SSH_PORT env var isn't set, default is 2222 — verify the port is open on the server.
- [ ] **Enable AI Trio Review** — Three-model parallel PR review (security / correctness / style) is fully built in `src/lib/ai-review-trio.ts` and wired into `src/lib/ai-review.ts`. Set `AI_TRIO_REVIEW_ENABLED=1` to activate. This is a genuine differentiator — no other platform has this.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Fix duplicate migration number 0065** — Renamed `0065_auto_generate_tests.sql` to `0077_auto_generate_tests.sql` (was conflicting with `0065_ai_cost_events.sql`). Both migrations now have unique numbers.
- [ ] **Set SERVER_TARGETS_KEY** — Server targets encrypt SSH private keys via AES. If `SERVER_TARGETS_KEY` env var isn't set, deploy target creation will fail silently. Set a 32-byte hex key in production.
- [ ] **Set PREVIEW_DOMAIN** — Branch preview URLs are computed as `${branchSlug}-${repoSlug}.preview.gluecron.com` or `PREVIEW_DOMAIN` env var. Set this to match where previews will actually be served.

---

## 🟠 PRIORITY 2 — Genuine Code Gaps (Need Building)

These are confirmed missing by direct code inspection.

- [ ] **Container registry (Docker/OCI)** — No files exist for this anywhere in the codebase. npm package registry is complete (`src/lib/packages.ts`). The OCI push/pull protocol needs implementing: `GET /v2/`, `HEAD /v2/:name/blobs/:digest`, `POST /v2/:name/blobs/uploads/`, `PUT /v2/:name/manifests/:ref`. Without Docker support, teams with containerised apps can't fully leave GitHub.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Redis SSE fan-out** — `src/lib/sse.ts` rewritten. When `REDIS_URL` or `VALKEY_URL` is set, uses two `Bun.RedisClient` instances (pub + sub) with `autoReconnect`. Topic-scoped SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE. On disconnect, re-subscribes all channels. Falls back to local delivery if Redis unreachable. In-memory path unchanged when no URL set. Zero API changes to callers.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Workflow cache SAVE** — `saveCacheEntry()` implemented in `src/lib/actions/cache-action.ts`. DB-backed via `workflow_run_cache` Postgres table; tarballs paths, SHA-256 hashes, 100MB cap, upserts content. Wired in `src/lib/workflow-runner.ts` post-job. LOAD unchanged.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Pack-content ruleset enforcement** — `commit_message_pattern`, `blocked_file_paths`, `max_file_size` now blocking at push time via pre-receive hook (`GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` env injection). Git commands: `git log --format="%H %s"`, `git diff --name-only`, `git cat-file -s`. Wired in `src/routes/git.ts` (HTTP) and `src/lib/ssh-server.ts` (SSH). All 10 push-policy + 23 ruleset tests pass.
- [x] 2026-06-06 commit:44ed968 **Branch preview expiry cleanup** — `expireOldPreviews()` wired as `preview-expiry` autopilot task in `src/lib/autopilot.ts`. Admin UI updated to show 10 tasks including `auto-merge-sweep`, `ai-build-from-issues`, and `preview-expiry`.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Server targets → customer-facing** — `src/routes/deploy-targets.tsx` (414 lines). `GET/POST /settings/deploy-targets`, `POST /settings/deploy-targets/:id/delete`, `POST /settings/deploy-targets/:id/test`. AES-256-GCM encryption via `SERVER_TARGETS_KEY`. Ownership-gated. Added to settings subnav and registered in `src/app.tsx`.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Claude Web Sessions → customer-facing** — `/:owner/:repo/claude` now open to all authenticated users with repo access. `listSessionsForUser()` scopes sessions to owner. Session list: colour-coded status badges, reverse-chron order. SSE stream via `GET /:owner/:repo/claude/:sessionId/stream?prompt=`. Spawns `claude --print --output-format stream-json`. "✨ Claude AI" sidebar card added to repo home (`src/routes/web.tsx`).
- [x] 2026-06-06 **AI budget hard enforcement** — `assertAiQuota(userId)` added to `src/lib/billing.ts` with 60s in-memory cache. Wired into `ai-review.ts` (posts skip comment), `ai-review-trio.ts` (fail-closed trio result), `ai-ci-healer.ts` (returns skipped), `spec-to-pr.ts` (returns error to UI). Warn at 90%, throw `AiQuotaExceededError` at 100%. Fails open on DB error.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Spec-to-Live real-time progress UI** — `src/routes/specs.tsx` (+593 lines). POST redirects to `/:owner/:repo/spec/:jobId/progress`. Polling (2s, &lt;20 lines JS) as primary; SSE endpoint as secondary. 8-stage timeline: analyzing→writing→opening_pr→ai_reviewing→gates_running→merging→deploying→done. In-memory `SpecJob` Map with 10-min eviction. No-JS server-render fallback.
- [ ] **Agent marketplace — real listings** — Migration `0070_agent_marketplace.sql` is complete with full schema (listings, installs, reviews, 30% revenue cut built in). The route `src/routes/marketplace-agents.tsx` exists. But there are only seed listings. Write a "Publish an agent" guide, reach out to 10 developers, get 20+ real listings.

---

## 🟡 PRIORITY 3 — Messaging (Every Page Needs This)

- [x] 2026-06-06 **Landing hero** (`src/views/landing.tsx`) — H1: "Write the spec. Gluecron ships it." Subhead: "Spec to PR in 90 seconds. Push to live in 25. AI review, auto-merge, deploy — automatic." Sleep Mode demoted to single closing clause. Rail label: "deploys shipped".
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Landing "what's happening now" rail** — Rail label updated; "Three reasons" card 1 rewritten to lead with timing numbers. Sleep Mode demoted to one line.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **vs-github AI rows** (`src/routes/vs-github.tsx`) — All 10 AI-native rows now have latency numbers: "AI review fires the moment PR opens (~8s)", "auto-merge triggers the instant gates pass", "ai:build → draft PR in 90 seconds", etc. Sleep Mode renamed to "async batch digest" — framed as opt-in, not the headline.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Demo page** (`src/routes/demo.tsx`) — Tile headings: "being built right now" / "merged the instant gates passed". Steps updated with real-time language. Live feed subtitle: "Happening right now". Empty states rewritten.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Sleep Mode demoted** — Demoted across landing (one closing clause) and vs-github (async opt-in framing). Never leads anywhere.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **OG/meta descriptions** — All pages audited. Landing title/desc: "AI-native git host. Spec to PR in 90 seconds." Pricing, vs-github, demo, explore, help: descriptions added. Per-repo pages: dynamic description. "wake up to", "overnight", "while you sleep" stripped everywhere including landing-2030.tsx body copy. Tests updated.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Pricing page** — Speed-first hero: monospace "Spec to PR in 90 seconds." accent stat, sub-copy with timing numbers. "Included in every plan" pill strip. All 4 plan card taglines mention AI review + auto-merge. OG/meta description added.

## 🔵 PRIORITY 4 — Polish & Customer Experience

### Onboarding
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Empty state for new repos** — 3-option panel in `src/routes/web.tsx`: git commands to push first commit, link to /import, link to /:owner/:repo/specs. Done in wave 1.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Onboarding email sequence** — `drizzle/0081_onboarding_emails.sql` adds `onboarding_emails_sent jsonb`. `src/lib/onboarding-drip.ts`: T+0 welcome (fire-and-forget in `auth.tsx` POST /register), T+1d "Try Spec-to-PR", T+3d "Your AI is watching" via `onboarding-drip` autopilot task. Idempotent via jsonb key tracking. Skips when RESEND_API_KEY unset.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Dashboard "AI just did this" widget** — `AiActivityWidget` added to `src/routes/dashboard.tsx`. Queries `audit_log` (auto_merge.merged, ai_build.dispatched) and `gate_runs` (status=repaired) for last 60 minutes. Shows per-category counts, item list with links, "All quiet — AI is watching." empty state.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Push Watch → make it discoverable** — Pulsing "● Live" badge in `RepoHeader` (red + `pushWatchPulse` animation when &lt;5min, muted "○ Watch" when &lt;24hr). Query on `activity_feed` WHERE action='push'. Eye-icon watch link on every commit row. `src/views/components.tsx`, `src/views/layout.tsx`, `src/routes/web.tsx`.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Repo overview AI stats strip** — `getRepoAiStats(repoId)` in `src/routes/web.tsx`. Shows "⚡ AI merged N PRs this week · Saved ~X hrs · N open security alerts" below file tree. Queries `activity_feed` (auto_merge), `pr_comments` (is_ai_review), `gate_runs` (security). Hidden when all zeros.

### Admin
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Admin > AI cost breakdown** — `/admin/ai-costs`: monthly total, breakdown by `category`, top 10 spenders with CSS bar chart. `ai_cost_events` JOIN `users`. Added to admin dashboard nav.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Admin > Stripe sync** — `src/routes/admin-stripe.tsx` at `/admin/stripe`. Fetches non-free users from `user_quotas`, calls live Stripe API per user, flags plan mismatches. `POST /admin/stripe/:userId/sync` corrects local plan to match Stripe. Degrades gracefully without STRIPE_SECRET_KEY.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Admin > Autopilot health** — `/admin/autopilot/health`: 10 tasks with last-tick status, duration, 24h success/error counts from `audit_log`. In-process `getLastTick()`/`getTickCount()` from autopilot.ts.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Admin > User growth chart** — `/admin/growth`: daily signups last 30 days (`date_trunc('day', created_at)`), activation rate (users with ≥1 repo), CSS bar chart table.
- [x] 2026-06-06 commit:44ed968 **K3 tasks on `/admin/autopilot`** — `auto-merge-sweep` and `ai-build-from-issues` were already present; `preview-expiry` added. Badge updated to "10 tasks".

### Developer Experience
- [x] 2026-06-06 **System/autopilot user** — `drizzle/0078_bot_user.sql` seeds `gluecron[bot]` (empty password_hash, non-loginable). `src/lib/bot-user.ts` lazy-caches the UUID. 10 comment call sites updated across `stale-sweep.ts`, `ai-review.ts`, `ai-review-trio.ts`, `autopilot.ts`. 🤖 bot pill shown in PR/issue comment headers.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Notification preferences** — Restructured into 4 categories in `src/routes/settings.tsx`: AI activity, CI/CD, Code review, Mentions. All existing `name=` attrs preserved — POST handler unchanged. Email pill count updated to 5 events.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Repo health badge on repo overview** — Health score badge added to `RepoHeader` in `src/routes/web.tsx`. Grade colours: Elite=green, Strong=blue, Improving=yellow, Needs Attention=red. Links to /:owner/:repo/insights/health. Done in wave 1.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **AI Trio Review UI indicator** — `TrioVerdictPills` component added to `src/routes/pulls.tsx`. Three pills (Security/Correctness/Style) in the PR header meta div. Feature-flagged on `AI_TRIO_REVIEW_ENABLED=1`. Pills link to `#trio-review-section`. No extra DB query — reads from already-fetched `prComments`.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **L1 sleep-mode column split** — `drizzle/0079_sleep_digest_column.sql` adds `last_sleep_digest_sent_at`. Schema updated. `sleep-mode.ts` and `autopilot.ts` now write/read the dedicated column. Tests updated. (Renamed from 0077 to avoid collision with `0077_auto_generate_tests.sql`.)
- [x] 2026-06-06 **GitHub unlink route** — `POST /settings/github/unlink` deletes `sso_user_links` rows with `subject` starting `"github:"`. "Disconnect GitHub" button shown on settings page when GitHub is linked. Audited via `auth.github.unlink`.
- [ ] **Branch preview expiry UX** — previews.tsx shows status pills (building/ready/failed/expired). Once expiry cleanup is wired, test the "expired" state renders correctly.

### Documentation & Help
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Docs site** — `src/routes/docs.tsx` (1600 lines). Routes: /docs, /docs/getting-started, /docs/workflow-yaml, /docs/mcp-server, /docs/api, /docs/agents. All 15 MCP tool names from mcp-tools.ts, real rate limits, real workflow YAML examples, agent.json manifest format. Footer "Docs" link updated.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Changelog page** — `src/routes/changelog.tsx` at `/changelog`. June + May 2026 releases listed. "Subscribe to updates" CTA → `/settings/notifications`. Changelog link added to footer in `layout.tsx`.
- [ ] **Legal pages attorney review** — All four legal pages (`terms`, `privacy`, `dmca`, `acceptable-use`) are substantive drafts marked "DRAFT — requires attorney review." Get legal sign-off before any paid launch.
- [x] 2026-06-06 **Status page — polish** — `drizzle/0080_incidents_and_status_subscribers.sql` adds `incidents` + `status_subscribers` tables. `src/routes/status.tsx` rewritten: overall status banner, 6 service uptime rows, last-10 incident history table, subscribe form with confirm/unsubscribe token flow.

## 💳 LAST — Stripe/Billing Configuration (When Platform Is Ready)

These are NOT build tasks — the code is 100% complete. Do these only after the platform is stable and ready for paying customers.

- [ ] **Set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY + STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET in production** — Stripe Checkout, customer portal, and webhook handler are 100% built (`src/lib/stripe.ts`, `src/routes/billing.tsx`, `src/routes/stripe-webhook.ts`). The billing UI even shows a warning when the key is missing. Run `scripts/stripe-bootstrap.ts` to create products/prices in Stripe with the right lookup keys (`gluecron_pro_monthly` etc), then set the secrets on Fly.io. Zero code changes needed.

---

## Notes

- `- [ ]` = not started / not configured
- `- [x] YYYY-MM-DD commit:abc` = done
- Bible is accurate but covers only ~35% of the codebase by file count
- 34 migrations beyond 0042 represent major post-Bible development
- When in doubt: scan the code, don't trust the Bible
